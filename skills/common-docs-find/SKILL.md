description: Find the right documentation file in a project using the standard Common docs/ structure. Use when asked where to find something, where to document something, which file covers a topic, or when about to read or write docs and need to know the correct location. Maps questions and topics to canonical file paths.

# Common Docs Finder

Map any question or topic to the correct file in the standard `docs/` structure.

## Lookup Table

## Workflow

1. **Identify the topic** from the user's question or task.
2. **Map it** using the lookup table above. When multiple files could apply, name all of them.
3. **Check whether the file exists** before reading it — the project may not have scaffolded every section.
4. **If the file doesn't exist**, say so and suggest either creating it (load `common-docs` skill) or checking `docs/index.md` for what is available.
5. **If the topic doesn't fit any section**, it likely belongs in `docs/context/` (domain knowledge) or a new `docs/guides/` entry.

## Where to Write New Content

Apply the same table in reverse — match the topic to the correct file before writing. If no file fits:

- Operational knowledge → new runbook in `docs/operations/runbooks/`
- A significant technical decision → new ADR in `docs/adr/`
- A new integration → new file in `docs/integrations/`
- A new feature spec → new file in `docs/plans/features/`
- Anything else → ask the user before creating a file outside the standard structure
